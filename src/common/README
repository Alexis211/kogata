This directory contains the library functions common to userland
and kernel code.

It relies on a few functions being exported :

- panic(char* msg, char* file, int line)
- panic_assert(char* assert, char* file, int line)
- dbg_print(const char* str)
- void* malloc(size_t size)
- free(void* ptr)

These function are supposed to be defined in the code that calls
the common functions. The headers for these functions are to be
found in `assert.h` and `malloc.h`.

Panic and panic_assert end the execution of the current program
(or of the kernel when in kernel-mode).
